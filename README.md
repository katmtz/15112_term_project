15112_term_project
==================

My term project is a top down, tile based RPG game. The map is randomly generated when a new 
game is initialized, through use of 2D Perlin Noise. 

**This is still very much a work in progress and doesn't really work. Also, all the graphics
are still placeholders and there's not much to show for it except that you can load a map.

It's due in like just over a week though so hopefully I can get stuff working by then.
