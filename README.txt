Restoration (game)
Katherine Martinez

Restoration is an RPG game, in which the user navigates a desert-exploring
character to collect items needed to "save" the planet. The map is 
randomly generated using Perlin noise functions.

To run Restoration, PyGame (and Python) must be installed. All other modules
and media are included in the file. If all modules are downloaded, the file
will run by building main.py in IDLE.

**KNOWN BUGS**
I was unfortunately unable to fix every bug I encountered. While none of 
them should crash the game, they cause some major problems with the game-
play. 

- The camera does not scroll, so you can walk off the screen while remaining
on the map.

- You can walk off the map, although you can also walk back onto the screen.
