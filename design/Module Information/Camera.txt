The Camera module creates a rect around the player, that should be 
able to update and move with the player. It should also determine
which tiles get drawn (but that isn't happening right now). 

getScrollDir() works similar to the player's update, in that it 
changes direction booleans according to which arrow key the user
pressed.

moveRect() adjusts the rect's location based on the directional
flag, then resets them all to False again. If the bounds check 
returns False, it reverses the change.

checkBounds() makes sure the rect is within the map dimensions. 

This module was based initially on code from 
http://stackoverflow.com/a/14357169 and https://qq.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
but neither method could be effectively implemented in my code
without major changes to my design. However, some influence may still
show up, and I wanted to account for that.

**Note: This function ended up not working, and at the time of
submission I think I'm close to understanding why, but I just don't 
have time to make any more changes. It still allows player movement, 
but just won't show the rest of the map. Unfortunately, this leaves 
my game pretty unplayable. :(
