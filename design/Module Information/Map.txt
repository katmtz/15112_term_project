The Map class holds a dictionary of references to each tile by topleft 
coordinates. It uses functions defined in MapOutput in __init__ to
create a temporary map file, then loads that file.

The main work is done in Map.getTiles(), because this iterates through
the map file's string, checking each placeholder symbol and deciding
which type of tile to assign to every row/col location. 

Map.GetLocationFromIndex(index) takes an index int (from getTiles()) 
and calculates what location (in rows and cols) that index corresponds 
to on the larger board. It returns a tuple of (x,y) coordinates.

getTiles() creates a dictionary, using the coordinates as keys and
the tile object as values. When it has iterated through the entire
file, it returns the dictionary.

Map.generate(screen) draws the map to the screen and is called only once.
