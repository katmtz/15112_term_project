The MapOutput module uses noise functions adapted from pseudocode
written by Hugo Elias to generate a map file that can be loaded
and parsed to create a map.

First, it builds an empty 2D list from given dimensions. It then
randomizes the values in each element of the list using the
noise function. After applying a few smoothing functions, it returns
a "noisy map". Then, it picks 5 random locations, determines that
these locations are not entirely surrounded by blocking tiles, and
flags them by setting them to a value of 20. 
Once the list is fully generated, getTypeStr(map) builds a string
that, for each element in the list, has one placeholder character
that corresponds to a certain range of values. There are 6 ranges 
and 6 characters, which can be set to the different kinds of tiles
when parsed later. 
The string is then saved as a map file, to the directory mapfiles, 
where it can then be accessed and loaded at any time during the 
current game.
