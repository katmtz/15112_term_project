The Player class holds the player's image, current movement 
direction, speed, and health.

player.update(up,down,left,right) takes 4 boolean arguments
that are determined in the keyPressed function in main.py. 
It sets the movement flags, then checks player bounds,
lowers health if the player is on a "bad" tile, and adjusts 
the player's rect in response to the movement flags.

player.checkBounds() checks to see if the player is not on
the board, and if it isn't, it adjusts the player's rect so
it is.

player.collide(walls) checks if the player is currently on 
a "bad" tile, and if it is, it lowers the player's health.

player.hasHealth() is a simple test to determine whether 
the player has run out of health.
