The Tile class defines the 6 different types of tiles
used in the map.
There are 2 kinds of blocking, "bad" tiles and 3 kinds
of ground tiles that aren't used for anything. There's 
also an item tile that changes to a ground tile when 
the player "collects" the item.
Each tile is a subclass of MapTile, which is just a more
specific version of pygame.sprite.Sprite.
The tile's image is loaded and defined within each specific tile's
__init__ function.
