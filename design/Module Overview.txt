Modules:

- Pygame
- MapOutput
- Camera
- Tile
- Map
- Player

Pygame was used to generate graphics and run the game in general.

MapOutput generates a 2D list, uses Perlin noise to create variant
terrain, and assigns a string type based on the value returned by
the noise function. It also saves and reloads a map file.

Camera creates a rect that focuses on the part of the map that the 
player is in.

Tile defines the different kinds of tile types used as pygame sprites.

Map generates a map using the file loaded by MapOutput.

Player is a subclass of pygame.sprite.Sprite that represents the user
controlled sprite. It's technically a subclass of Entity, but Entity 
is just a wrapper with no unique features, so I excluded it from my
explanations.
