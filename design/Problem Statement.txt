Problem:
Design a game that will have replayability. Most RPG games are fun in
their own right, but lack a way to re-experience the game. Once 
you've played it through once, there's little reason to play it again.

Restoration uses random map generation, so the game is never the same
twice. Even if you find all the items once, after reloading the game,
you have to start all over again. While the features of this game
would need to be expanded to be a really interesting game, the basis 
needed to do that is all built in this game.  

I was most strongly influenced by the Perlin Noise Island Generator 
(which is listed in my comparative analysis) and the indie game Yume 
Nikki. Initially I had hoped for a richer game system, but due to 
time, I had to pare down a lot of the features. I modeled a lot of 
the gameplay on that of Yume Nikki, because that game has a similar
objective to mine - collect all the items you need to achieve a 
final goal.
