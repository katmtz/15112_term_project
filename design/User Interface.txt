I opted for simple, keyboard-based controls because I felt that
suited the genre and overall style of my game. I noticed during
user studies that many people expected mouse controls though, so 
I hid the mouse in the window and left a reminder in the title 
page that the arrow keys were used for menu navigation.

I chose to have a story mode when loading the game because the 
map takes some time to load and having a blank screen while this
was happening seemed boring and detrimental. Using this method,
users are still engaged while the game is being built and it adds
context to an otherwise abstract game.
